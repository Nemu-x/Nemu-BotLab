## Implementation Gaps

Based on the frontend code analysis, there are several endpoints that are referenced but not fully implemented on the backend:

1. **Dashboard Analytics APIs**:
   - `/api/dashboard/stats`
   - `/api/dashboard/activity`
   - `/api/dashboard/time-analytics`
   
   These endpoints are called in the Dashboard page but return 404 errors, indicating they are not yet implemented on the backend.

2. **Analytics Endpoints**:
   - Various analytics endpoints for messages, commands, flows, and tickets are not implemented
   - The frontend has UI placeholders for these analytics, but the backend APIs are missing

3. **Advanced Features**:
   - Token refresh functionality is referenced but not implemented
   - Flow step reordering capability is referenced but not implemented
   - User activity tracking is referenced but not implemented

## Development Priorities

Based on the implementation gaps, the following development priorities are suggested:

1. **High Priority**:
   - Implement the dashboard statistics APIs to fix the 404 errors on the main dashboard
   - Implement activity tracking for a complete view of system usage

2. **Medium Priority**:
   - Implement analytics endpoints for messages, commands, flows, and tickets
   - Implement token refresh functionality for better security

3. **Low Priority**:
   - Implement advanced features like flow step reordering
   - Implement detailed command usage statistics
